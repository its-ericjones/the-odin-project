    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"This Buffalo chicken mac and cheese recipe was first introduced to me at my local ballpark, and I thought it was a great idea! This is what I whipped up. Serve with celery sticks and beer. Let me know what you think." - Matt R</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>1 rotisserie-roasted chicken</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup hot sauce (such as Frank's® Redhot®), or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Cut wings and legs off rotisserie chicken. Remove skin and bones from wings and legs; chop or shred dark meat into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Gradually whisk in flour until a thick paste forms. Cook until golden, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour in milk, whisking constantly, until thickened and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until sauce is smooth, about 1 minute more. Reduce heat and season with pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir Cheddar and Monterey Jack into the sauce until melted and combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in hot sauce to the desired level of spiciness.</li>
            <li>Add Gorgonzola, chicken, and macaroni; mix well to combine.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
